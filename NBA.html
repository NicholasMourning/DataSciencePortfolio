        <h1>Project: NBA Salary Prediction</h1>

        <h2>Introduce the Problem</h2>
        <p>For this project, I am going to be using linear regression to predict an NBA player's salary using features such as points, assists, rebounds, and games played. This model will also help understand what are valuable features of a player.</p>

        <h2>Introduce the Data</h2>
        <p>For the data used to create the model, I am using a database from Kaggle titled “NBA Players Performance and Salaries” found here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/exploring-nba-player-performance-and-salaries-19">NBA Players Performance and Salaries</a>.</p>
        <div class="preprocessing">
            <h2>Pre-processing</h2>
            <p>The data was split into two datasets, one called 'players' with all the player stats and one called 'salaries' with all the player salaries. I merged the two datasets on their 'player_id' to create one dataset.</p>
            <p>Next, I dropped all the columns with null features because they were not needed for this dataset. Then, I split the data between <code>X</code> (the features used for prediction) and <code>y</code> (the target, which is the salary).</p>

        <div class="evaluation">
            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>From the model, we achieved a score of 0.26. The most important feature contributing to this score was 'rebounds,' indicating that rebounds are a desirable trait in determining player salary.</p>

        <div class="impact">
            <h2>Storytelling and Impact</h2>
            <p>This project demonstrates that certain player stats, such as rebounds, have a significant impact on salary. By identifying these key features, teams and analysts can better assess player value and salary potential.</p>
