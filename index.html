            <p>The graph above is from the dataset Mental Health in Tech Survey. Participants were asked the question "if you have a mental health condition, do you feel that if interferes with your work?" The results shows results of Often, Rarley, Never, or Sometimes. 
                With this data we can infer that mental health conditions do interfere with ones work and is important to consider how to pervent  negative mental health conditions at work and what conditions would make us effective workers.</p>
