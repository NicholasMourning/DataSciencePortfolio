        <h3>Project 1 : Mental Health in the Technology Field</h3>
            <h4>Problem set out to Solve:</h4>
            <p>With this dataset I would like to seek out answers on how to have a healthy lifestyle while pursing a tech job. I would like to inform others and myself on what is an ideal tech job for ones mental health and how to have a healthy work life balance.</p>
            <img id="work-interference-graph" src="/images/Mental-health-interference.png" alt="work-interference-graph">
            <p>The graph above is from the dataset Mental Health in Tech Survey. Participants were asked the question "if you have a mental health condition, do you feel that if interferes with your work?" The results shows results of Often, Rarley, Never, or Sometimes. 
                With this data we can infer that mental health conditions do interfere with ones work and is important to consider how to pervent  negative mental health conditions at work and what conditions would make us effective workers.</p>
            <h4>Data showing how to have healthy mental health in Tech Jobs:</h4>
                <div class="mental-health-img">
                    <img src="images/Sometimes.png" alt="Sometimes Image">
                    <img src="images/Often.png" alt="Often Image">
                    <img src="images/Rarely.png" alt="Rarely Image">
                </div>
            <p> The graphs shown above from the data set shows that the group that often, Rarely, and sometimes feels mental health interferes with their work and their answers to wether they work at home or not at least 50% of the time.
                The data shows that most people who have mental health problems that interfere with their work are often people who go into the office and do not work from home.

                <ul>
                    <li>First I found all of the Null values for the work-interference column becuase I am only working with those who have mental health work inteference so all other data is obsolet. </li>
                    <li><img src="images/preprocessing/NullValues.png"></li>
                    <li>Then I created a dataframe with only those values</li>
                    <li><img src="images/preprocessing/cleaned_df.png"></li>
                    <li>Then I processed to create a dataframe with each outcome of the work-interference-graph so I will be able to get a better understand of what is contributing to each persons poor mental health when working</li>
